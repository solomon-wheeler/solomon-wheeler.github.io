  <p class = "w3-center" id = "demo" ></p>
  <p class =" w3-center"> Welcome to my website, which I've made to link to showcase some of my programing, for which I have uploaded my code on github , as well as detailing other projects I have been involved in.
   I do most of my programming in python as well as some vb.net and  HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which I've used to make this website.
   I'm currently in Year 12, and I'm studying Maths, Physics and Computer Science.

<h3 class ="w3-center"> Train Data</h3>
<div class="w3-row">

<div class="w3-col l6 s12 w3-center"><p> This is a program coded in python which uses the national rail open data Historical service Performance API,
which allows me to get data on all of the train services for the last year,
 I use this data to output the average delay, percent delayed, percent cancelled, operator and delay on arrival,
  as well as plotting the delay data on a scatter graph for each service. The data is shown in the users browser,
  I did this by editing html templates I had created in the python script, and by using Plotly's to_html facility for the scatter graphs </p>

<h3 class="w3-center">Train Visualiser </h3>
<div class="w3-row">
  <div class="w3-col l6 s12 w3-center"><p>This is a program that I wrote which shows all of the trains on the branches that go through Wokingham Station, it gets there live location from the National Rail API and uses this to work out the time of there next stop
  as well as the time of there last stop, it then works out the trains approximate position between stations.
  The data is visualised using pygame. I made this program quite along time ago, and although It seems to work I haven't done any testing on it,
  so I'm sure there are lots of bugs I haven't noticed, as well as this the coding is incredibly messy, so enter the github repository at your own risk.
  The image is of an example output.  </p>

  <div class="w3-col l6 s12 w3-center"><p>
  This program allows for the visualisation of directed and undirected graphs, which can be randomly created or made by the user. The program will then use Primm's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree for this graph from a specified node

  <div class="w3-col l6 s12 w3-center"><p>
    I know this sounds Like something from Dr. Doofenshmirtz would  have made but I promise it's not, it uses the Spotify api to get information and how popular your favourite Spotify artists are, and uses this to work out how "Edgy" the music you listen to is

  and there actual arrival times, and uses this to work out how likely your
  bus is to be on time based on historical data, it does this by comparing all of the data for the last two weeks and working an average delay for each stop</p></div>

     it covered a range of issues including veganism , Knife crime , and Fast Fashion. Being the editor gave me the chance to learn how to use Reaper,

  <div class="w3-row">

  <div class="w3-col l6 s12 w3-center"><p> This website was made primarily using HTML, as well as w3.css and css for styling it, this was mainly because w3.css is responsive,
     so hopefully this website dosen't look terrible on mobile, and because I hate css, so anything that meant I had to right less of it was highly
      appreciated. I learnt how to do the parallax effect using w3 schools, and I learnt the Java script necessary for the changing age from there as well.

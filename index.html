<h3 class ="w3-center"> Train Data</h3>
<div class="w3-row">

<div class="w3-col l6 s12 w3-center"><p> This is a program coded in python which uses the national rail open data Historical service Perromanace API, 
which allows me to get data on all of the train services for the last year,
 I use this data to ouput the average delay, percent delayed, percent cancelled, operator and delay on arrival,
  aswell as plotting the delay data on a scatter graph for each service. The data is shown in the users browser, 
  I did this by editing html templates I had created in the python script, and by using Plotly's to_html facility for the scatter graphs </p>

<div class="w3-row">
  <div class="w3-col l6 s12 w3-center"><p>This code gets the scheduled arrival times of buses
  and there actual arrival times, and uses this to work out how likely your
  bus is to be on time based on historical data, it does this by comapring all of the data for the last two weeks and working an average delay for each stop</p></div>

<div class="w3-col l6 s12 w3-center"><p>I was one of the editors on the Youth Rising Podcast, which was a podcast based around young peoples issues that aired between February and June 2020, it covered a range of issues including Veganism , Knife crime , and Fast Fashion. Being the editor gave me the chance to learn how to use Reaper, which we used for editing the audio, aswell as this I got to give ideas for what the topics of podcasts should be. Give it a listen by clicking the picture! </p></div>

<div class="w3-row">

<div class="w3-col l6 s12 w3-center"><p> This website was made primarily using HTML, aswell as w3.css and css for sytling it, this was mainly because w3.css is responsive, so hopefully this website dosen't look terrible on mobile, and becasue I hate css, so anything that meant I had to right less of it was highly appreciated. I learnt how to do the parralax effect using w3 schools, and I learnt the Java script nesscary for the changing age from there aswell.
